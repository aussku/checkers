# What Are Checkers
3 Player Checkers is a game based on a classic Checkers game where 2 players play against each other. Checkers, in itself, is a strategy turn-based board game; each player takes turns moving their checkers according to specific rules. Players must defend their checkers and defeat the foe's checkers. The game is considered finished once only one of the player's checkers remains on the board; the winner is the one who still has at least one of his checkers.

3 Player Checkers are mostly the same; the differences are in the board, and the movement rules are a bit different.
